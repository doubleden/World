When creating a new world, he fills it with cells. Each time a button is pressed in the application, a new cell is added to the list:

— It can be either alive or dead with equal probability;

— Life is born if three living cells have been created in a row;

— If three dead cells are created in a row, life nearby dies.

Initially, the list of cells is empty. You may use third-party libraries.
